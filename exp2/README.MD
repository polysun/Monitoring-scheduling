According to the comparison, ACO_DSP performs best in almost all cases (31/34). 
Although the results of ACO_Level in the case of data generated based on the channel are better than those in the case of data generated by random, compared to the ACO_DSP method, there are still 1/3 cases inferior to it. Therefore, the experiment also shows the effectiveness of our proposed ACO_DSP.
