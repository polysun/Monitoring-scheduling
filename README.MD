## This open-source repository records the experimental comparison results of our design algorithms with several methods on vessel pollutant monitoring. 

#### The related paper of the repository is accepted by IEEE Transactions on intelligent transportation systems and will be soon published.

#### The exp1 folder contains all the data results of experiments using the vessel data generated by random.
#### The exp2 folder contains all the data results of experiments using the vessel data generated based on the channel.
