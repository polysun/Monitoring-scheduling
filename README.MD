## This open-source repository records the experimental comparison results of our design algorithms with several methods on vessel pollutant monitoring. We have submitted our paper to IEEE Transactions on intelligent transportation systems. More experimental details will be available for reference and use by more people after the paper is accepted.
#### The exp1 folder contains all the data results of experiments using the vessel data generated by random.
#### The exp2 folder contains all the data results of experiments using the vessel data generated based on the channel.
